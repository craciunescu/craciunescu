I code from time to time. Shocker, right? I'm currently in between projects, so expect a pretty big mess in here. I'm also working on some non-coding stuff (starting a tech blog soon 💯).

I'm a sucker for ice-cream, and I love climbing (I've never tried ice-cream __while__ climbing, now that I think about it 🍦🧗🏼‍♂️) Currently working at [Autentia](https://autentia.com) and preparing for technical interviews.
